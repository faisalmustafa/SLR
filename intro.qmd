Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has become more increasingly popular among researchers. This type of research refers to a systematic process of obtaining reliable literature to be analyze and synthesize *accurately*. What differentiate this type of literature review to traditional one is that SLR emphasizes on systematicity, which means that all process in SLR research is reproducable. Therefore, researchers need to report all process accurately and in details, while maintaining that the process lead to accurate research findings. SLR is significant for some reasons. 

First, SLR helps summarize the results of previous studies on a particular topic. The results of studies can be summarize into several themes, which reveal what we already know about centain phenomenon. Each theme can be described in detail and discussed critically by the SLR researchers. Therefore, readers of an SLR paper will be informed of all current findings and how comprehensive research has been conducted in the topics along with further research required to supplement for the information in the literature. Thus, it is adviced that novice researchers, such as new lecturers or graduate students, explore a topic through SLR papers as a way to come up with topics for their future research. 

Second, SLR can be used to determine how *something* is conceptualized in the literature. For example, education researchers consider their teaching method as innovative. However, detailed analysis of the method shows that they only modified existing teaching methods or add technological component to it. Therefore, there is a need to determine how innovativeness is conceptualized in the context of teaching. SLR can be used for this purpose. As an example, read @Jiang2025's <a href="/resources/papers/jiang2025.pdf"> <img src="download-icon.png" alt="W3Schools" width="25" height="25"> </a> work as an example of how student welbeing is conceptualized using SLR research.

Third, SLR can be used to establish a theoritical framework on a recently established topic in the literature. This is necessary when a researcher needs to construct a questionnaire or scale for measurement for quantitative research or other practical purposes. For example, using a systematic literature review @ellis2020 <a href="/resources/papers/ellis2020.pdf"> <img src="download-icon.png" alt="W3Schools" width="25" height="25"> </a> established dimensions of a quality pre-service teacher mentors which can be regarded as a framework which can be used to analyse the quality of a pre-service teacher mentor in qualitative research or to design a survey in quantitative research.

Finally, SLR can be used to find best practices of implementing a method or policy or anything based on previous studies. These best practices can be used to device a plan on implementation of evidence-based program in the community. One of the examples of this systematic literature review was conducted by myself, supported by my supervisors, at the early stage of my PhD study [@mustafa2024] <a href="/resources/papers/mustafa2024.pdf"> <img src="download-icon.png" alt="W3Schools" width="25" height="25"> </a>. Based on the solutions for challenges of technology in rural schools, I established best practices of technology application in rural schools, which can be used by the government in planning this program.
