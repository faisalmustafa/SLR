    "text": "Learning this type of research was quite a journey for myself, and thus I do not intend to let this process goes to waste because not all academicians have a learning chance as I did. Therefore, the purpose of this book is to describe the process of Systematic Literature Review research as I learned it through reading and collaborations. Allow me to share how I learned this type of research before I describe how this book is presented.\nThe process goes back to late 2022 when I started by PhD at the UNSW Sydney in Summer Semester 2023. I only have a chance to meet my supervisors briefly once before they both went on their summer holiday. I was advice to review the literature using NVIVO to decide whether I needed to change the focus of my research. I started by learning NVIVO by watching a 12 hour NVIVO tutorial, which in my case was adequate to start my literature review. I send a report to my supervisors after one month. I received comments from my supervisors and one of them indicated that my work could be published. I started reading more and watching more vidoes on conducting systematic literature review research. I finally published the result of this systematic literature review research in a reputable journal as my first systematic literature review paper.\nIn 2024 I was involved in a UNESCO project related to digital transformation in higher education led by my supervisor, who put much focus on reliability and accuracy. I was offered to work in the project as a research assistant after the project started, so I was not involved from the beginning. I learned more about coding process involving multiple cycle inter-coder reliability attempts to ensure that all coders had adequate levels of agreement in coding the literature.\nFinally, I was involved to work in a big systematic literature review project related to culturally responsive pedagogy, also led by my supervisor. This project run the entire 2025 with weekly meeting. There were two publication intended from the project, one was to conceptualize the culturally responsive pedagogy, and another was to determine how pre-service teachers were prepared to teach diverse students. I learned a lot from this process, especially on making the systematic literature review research accurate, reliable, and reproducable. After completing this project, I was confident that I can start mentoring novice systematic literature review researchers.\nThis online version book reflects my own understanding of what systematic literature review research is and how to make it entirely systematic, reliable, accurate, and reproducable. Therefore, there is no citation used in this book because I did not refer to any sources when writing it, unless it is very necessary or when readers need to read some texts to understand the point that I was making. Since the book emphasizes on practicality, the language used was not always academic; thus, you can find casual expressions used very often in this book. I hope you don’t mind."

    "text": "Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has become more increasingly popular among researchers. This type of research refers to a systematic process of obtaining reliable literature to be analyze and synthesize accurately. What differentiate this type of literature review to traditional one is that SLR emphasizes on systematicity, which means that all process in SLR research is reproducable. Therefore, researchers need to report all process accurately and in details, while maintaining that the process lead to accurate research findings. SLR is significant for some reasons.\nFirst, SLR helps summarize the results of previous studies on a particular topic. The results of studies can be summarize into several themes, which reveal what we already know about centain phenomenon. Each theme can be described in detail and discussed critically by the SLR researchers. Therefore, readers of an SLR paper will be informed of all current findings and how comprehensive research has been conducted in the topics along with further research required to supplement for the information in the literature. Thus, it is adviced that novice researchers, such as new lecturers or graduate students, explore a topic through SLR papers as a way to come up with topics for their future research.\nSecond, SLR can be used to determine how something is conceptualized in the literature. For example, education researchers consider their teaching method as innovative. However, detailed analysis of the method shows that they only modified existing teaching methods or add technological component to it. Therefore, there is a need to determine how innovativeness is conceptualized in the context of teaching. SLR can be used for this purpose. As an example, read Jiang et al. (2025)’s   work as an example of how student welbeing is conceptualized using SLR research.\nThird, SLR can be used to establish a theoritical framework on a recently established topic in the literature. This is necessary when a researcher needs to construct a questionnaire or scale for measurement for quantitative research or other practical purposes. For example, using a systematic literature review Ellis et al. (2020)   established dimensions of a quality pre-service teacher mentors which can be regarded as a framework which can be used to analyse the quality of a pre-service teacher mentor in qualitative research or to design a survey in quantitative research.\nFinally, SLR can be used to find best practices of implementing a method or policy or anything based on previous studies. These best practices can be used to device a plan on implementation of evidence-based program in the community. One of the examples of this systematic literature review was conducted by myself, supported by my supervisors, at the early stage of my PhD study (Mustafa et al., 2024)  . Based on the solutions for challenges of technology in rural schools, I established best practices of technology application in rural schools, which can be used by the government in planning this program.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nEllis, N.

Experienced researchers consider the significance of the SLR and the availability of reviewed studies in determining the toopics of SLR. In some of my own collaboration projects, we used SLR to define and conceptualized a new concept. Second, select the leading databases from which the articles to be reviewed will be extracted. In my case, since systematic literature review topics revolve around education, I would select Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest Education. The selection of these databases need to be justified in the methodology section of your article. Third, your topic for systematic literature review is then translated into keywords to be used to search the studies related to your selected topic. The search results are extracted and duplicates are removed. Further process is more intensive, where the title and abstract of the extracted studies need to be read to determine whether the studies meet the inclusion criteria. This step is usually completed by more than one team members, and it is recommended so, adequate inter-rater reliability needs to be established at the early stage of this abstract screening process. The full texts of all included studies are retried and screened further. At this stage the quality of each study is assessed using a quality appraisal rubric, accompanied with inter-rater reliability process.",

In this step, first the team members have to agree on what framework will be used to organize the code. The framework is used as the primary components of the codebook. Before the real coding process starts, adequate inter-coder reliability needs to be established among the team member involved in this process. This process can take mutiple practice coding cycles. Finally, the studies to be coded are distributed among the team members to code independently based on the establihed codebook.",
