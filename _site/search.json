    "text": "Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has become more increasingly popular among researchers. This type of research refers to a systematic process of obtaining reliable literature to be analyze and synthesize accurately. What differentiate this type of literature review to traditional one is that SLR emphasizes on systematicity, which means that all process in SLR research is reproducable. Therefore, researchers need to report all process accurately and in details, while maintaining that the process lead to accurate research findings.\nSLR is significant for some reasons. First, it helps summarize the results of previous studies on a particular topic. The results of studies can be summarize into several themes, which reveal what we already know about centain phenomenon.",

Experienced researchers consider the significance of the SLR and the availability of reviewed studies in determining the toopics of SLR. In some of my own collaboration projects, we used SLR to define and conceptualized a new concept. Second, select the leading databases from which the articles to be reviewed will be extracted. In my case, since systematic literature review topics revolve around education, I would select Scopus, Web of Science and ProQuest Education. The selection of these databases need to be justified in the methodology section of your article. Third, your topic for systematic literature review is then translated into keywords to be used to search the studies related to your selected topic. The search results are extracted and duplicates are removed. Further process is more intensive, where the title and abstract of the extracted studies need to be read to determine whether the studies meet the inclusion criteria. This step is usually completed by more than one team members, and it is recommended so, adequate inter-rater reliability needs to be established at the early stage of this abstract screening process. The full texts of all included studies are retried and screened further. At this stage the quality of each study is assessed using a quality appraisal rubric, accompanied with inter-rater reliability process.",

In this step, first the team members have to agree on what framework will be used to organize the code. The framework is used as the primary components of the codebook. Before the real coding process starts, adequate inter-coder reliability needs to be established among the team member involved in this process. This process can take mutiple practice coding cycles. Finally, the studies to be coded are distributed among the team members to code independently based on the establihed codebook.",

The method section can also provide the description of the reviewed studies such as year or publication, region where research was conducted, and other relevant information. If these overview data are closely tied to the research result in the codebook, they can be provided in the result section. After completing the result section, it becomes easier to write the introduction sections. Discussion section, followed by the conclusion section, can be prepared after other sections are completed.",
